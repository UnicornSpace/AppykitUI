# AppyKit

**AppyKit** is a learning hub I wish I had when I started learning Flutter.

It’s built to help developers learn **Dart & Flutter**, explore **app design ideas**, and discover **useful developer resources** — all in one place.

## What you’ll find here

-  **Flutter & Dart learning notes**  
  Beginner to intermediate concepts explained in a simple way.

-  **App design ideas**  
  UI/UX inspirations and practical layout approaches.

-  **Mini examples & experiments**  
  Small, focused implementations to understand concepts faster.

- 🛠️ **Developer resources**  
  Tools, libraries, and references that are actually useful.

##  Why AppyKit?

Learning Flutter can feel overwhelming at first.  
AppyKit exists to:

- Make learning **simpler and more relatable**
- Share **real-world explanations**, not just theory
- Act as a **personal knowledge base** that others can learn from too

## 👩‍💻 Who is this for?

- Flutter beginners  
- Developers revising core concepts  
- Anyone looking for **practical Flutter guidance**

##  Status

This project is **actively growing** as I continue learning and building with Flutter.
