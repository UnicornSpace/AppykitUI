## Why use AISDK
Each provider(OpenAI, Anthropic, XAi, etc) typically has its own unique method for interfacing with their models, complicating the process of switching providers and increasing the risk of vendor lock-in.

The AI SDK standardizes integrating artificial intelligence (AI) models across supported providers. This enables developers to focus on building great AI applications, not waste time on technical details.

## Understanding the library

It's divided into 3 major parts:

1. AI SDK Core: A unified, provider agnostic API for generating text, structured objects, and tool calls with LLMs.
2. AI SDK UI: A set of framework-agnostic hooks for building chat and generative user interfaces.
3. AI SDK RSC: Stream generative user interfaces with React Server Components (RSC). Development is currently experimental and we recommend using AI SDK UI.
