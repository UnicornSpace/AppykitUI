## Images in Flutter
- In Flutter, images are an essential part of building visually appealing applications. Flutter provides several ways to work with images, including loading images from assets, network, and file system.

### If you want to load the image from URL 
```dart
Image.network('https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1500835556837-99ac94a94552?w=600&auto=format&fit=crop&q=60&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8Nnx8dHJhdmVsbGluZ3xlbnwwfHwwfHx8MA%3D%3D')
```

### If you want to load the image from assets

1. First, create directory `images` in your project root and add your image there.
2. Then, go to `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following lines:
```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - images/
```

3. Finally, use the `Image.asset` widget to display the image:
```dart
Image.asset('assets/images/your_image.png')
```
