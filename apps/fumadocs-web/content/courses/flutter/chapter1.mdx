## Flutter

- Its a toolkit, that makes it easy for devloper to desgin a beautiful interfaces for all souce of devices
- It just takes blank screen of ur ANDROID/IOS and draws on it
- We just make use of few pre-built widgets to make our user interfaces which look like its made in native code.

## Why Flutter

1.  One CodeBase -> Its a cross-platflorm , write the code once and it runs on both the platform of IOS and ANDROID.
2.  One Language -> Dart is Language which we used to build apps (ANDROID and IOS) and webapps
3.  Hot Reloading -> When the changes are made , it will be reflecting on spot
4. Access to Original Source Code -> Flutter is Open Source, so we can access the original source code of flutter and can make changes if needed
5.  Flexible and Simple Layout System
    - ### Constraint Based Layout
           Every parent widget tells its child widget:

           👉 “This is how big (or small) you’re allowed to be.”
