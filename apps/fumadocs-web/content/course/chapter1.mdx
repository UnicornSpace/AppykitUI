## Introduction to React Native and Expo

### What is React Native?
- React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. 
- It allows developers to create apps for both iOS and Android platforms using a single codebase.
- If u think in business level, if companies want to build apps for both iOS and Android, they need to hire two different teams, one for iOS and one for Android. But with React Native, they can hire just one team to build apps for both platforms, which saves time and money.

### What is Expo?
- Expo is a framework and platform for universal React applications. It provides a set of tools and services that simplify the development process of React Native apps.
- Expo allows developers to build, deploy, and iterate on their apps quickly without needing to configure native code.

### What is the difference between React Native and Expo?
- React Native is the core framework for building mobile apps, while Expo is a set of tools and services built on top of React Native.
- Expo provides a managed workflow that simplifies the development process, allowing developers to focus on writing JavaScript code without worrying about native configurations.

### What is the Difference between the Native Components and Core Components?
- Native components are platform-specific components that are written in native code (Java/Kotlin for Android and Objective-C/Swift for iOS). They provide access to platform-specific features and APIs.
- Core components are cross-platform components provided by React Native that can be used in both iOS and Android apps. They are written in JavaScript and provide a consistent API across platforms.

### How it works?
- The Button components in Android is written as **ButtonView** and in iOS it is written as **UIButton**.
- This ReactNative JavaScript will wrap around the native components and provide a unified API for both platforms.
