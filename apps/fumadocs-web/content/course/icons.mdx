## From where can we import icons?
1. We can use the `expo/vector-icons` package to import icons in React Native Expo.
```javascript
import { Ionicons } from '@expo/vector-icons';
```
- In expo/vector-icons You can find a wide range of icons from different icon sets like MaterialIcons, FontAwesome, Ionicons, etc.

2. To maintain consistency in your app  and avoid the confusion of using different icon sets, it is recommended to use a single icon set throughout your app.
- Use Lucide icons for a consistent look and feel.
```javascript
npm install lucide-react-native
```
```javascript
import { Home } from 'lucide-react-native';
```
