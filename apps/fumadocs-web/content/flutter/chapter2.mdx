## Installation And Setup
1. Install Flutter SDK
   - Go to the official Flutter website: [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
   
2. Install Android Studio
   - Download and install Android Studio from [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

## If you’re on Windows  + Android Studio
- You can only run Android emulators (Pixel, Samsung, etc.).
- You cannot run iOS simulators on Windows, because Apple restricts iOS simulators to macOS only.


## Third-party tools in the Flutter ecosystem
### 1. FlutterFlow
- A low-code/no-code builder for Flutter apps.
- Works like Figma for Flutter — you drag & drop UI, set logic, and it generates Flutter code for you.
- Supports Firebase integration, APIs, and even deploying apps.
- Good for: UI prototyping, fast MVPs, non-developers building Flutter apps.

### 2. Codemagic
- A CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) tool made for Flutter.
- Automates building, testing, and publishing your Flutter apps.
Example: Push code to GitHub → Codemagic builds Android APK + iOS IPA → uploads to Play Store / App Store automatically.
- Saves time because setting up iOS builds on your own Mac is painful — Codemagic does it in the cloud.
  - Good for: Automating app releases and team collaboration.

### 3. Mason 🧱

- A code generator tool for Flutter/Dart.
- Think of it like “templates on steroids.” You create bricks (reusable code snippets/templates).
  - Example: Instead of writing the same bloc or feature folder structure again and again, you can just run mason make feature and it generates everything.
- Good for: boosting developer productivity and maintaining consistent project structure.
