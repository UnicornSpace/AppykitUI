## Why we started AppyKitUI

React Native developers deserve a modern UI experience.  
We noticed a gap — many existing UI solutions feel rigid, outdated, or lack the finesse expected in today’s mobile apps. Animations are often missing, spacing is inconsistent, and theming support is limited. Developers frequently turn to design platforms like Dribbble or TikTok for inspiration, then end up rebuilding components from scratch.

**AppyKitUI** aims to change that.  
We’re creating a design-forward, modular, and developer-friendly UI toolkit built specifically for the React Native ecosystem — powered by **Expo**, **NativeWind**, and **React Native Primitives**. It’s built for speed, flexibility, and customization — so you can focus on building apps, not reinventing components.

## What's our mission?

To create the most **developer-friendly** and **aesthetically modern** open-source UI library for React Native.  
We want to:

- Empower developers with **modular, accessible components**
- Offer **great theming support** using NativeWind
- Provide a **CLI-first experience** for ease of integration
- Encourage a **community-driven** ecosystem

Our goal is simple:  
**Let you build beautiful mobile apps faster, with less hassle.**

## Who are we?

We’re a small team of developers passionate about **developer experience**, **modern UI systems**, and **open-source tools** that empower others to build faster and better.

We’ve built projects using React Native, faced the common UI frustrations firsthand, and decided to create a toolkit that reflects today’s design needs — and feels truly developer-first.
