## How to Get Started?
- See We have a browser based Dart Editor called DartPad (https://dartpad.dev/) where you can write and run Dart code directly in your browser without any setup.
{/* TODO: Add a screenshot or GIF of DartPad interface */}

- NOTE: The main function is the entry point of every Dart application. When you run a Dart program, the execution starts from the main function.



## What are Variables in Dart?
- As in every programming language, Variables are used to store data values that can be used and manipulated throughout the program.
- Its like a container that used to store values and reuse them later.

{/* TODO: ScreenShort of container */}

### How to Declare Variables in Dart?
- It startes with the data type followed by the variable name and which is assigned to a value using the assignment operator (=).

{/* TODO:  Image of Syntax */}

### Example
```dart
void main() {
  // Declaring variables
  int age = 25; // Integer variable
  double height = 5.9; // Double variable
  String name = 'John'; // String variable
  bool isStudent = true; // Boolean variable

  // Printing variables
  print('Name: $name');
  print('Age: $age');
  print('Height: $height');
  print('Is Student: $isStudent');
}
```
Note: This is called as **Statically Typed Variables**: Where we explicitly specify the data type of the variable during declaration.
Try this code in DartPad to see the output.


- **Dynamically Typed Variables**: In Dart, we can also declare variables without specifying the data type explicitly using the `var` ,`const`,`dynamic` and `const` keyword. 

{/* TODO: Image that says diff btw var & dynamic and const & final */}

####  Using `var` keyword - Used when you want to redefine the variable later.
```dart
void main() {
  var city = 'New York'; // Implicitly typed as String
  print('City: $city');

  city = 'Los Angeles'; // Reassigning a new value
  print('Updated City: $city');
}
```
####  Using `dynamic` keyword - It is similar to `var` but it can hold values of any data type and can be changed at runtime.

```dart
void main() {
  dynamic data = 42; // Initially an integer
  print('Data: $data');

  data = 'Hello'; // Now a string
  print('Updated Data: $data');

  data = true; // Now a boolean
  print('Final Data: $data');
}
```
####  Using `const` keyword - The value assigned to a `const` variable cannot be changed later.

```dart
void main() {
  const pi = 3.14; // Constant variable
  print('Value of pi: $pi');

  // pi = 3.14159; // This will cause a compile-time error
}
```

#### Using `final` keyword - Its similar to `const`, but the value can be assigned only once and can be determined at runtime.

```dart
void main() {
  final currentTime = DateTime.now(); // Final variable
  print('Current Time: $currentTime');

  // currentTime = DateTime.now(); // This will cause a compile-time error
}
```


## What is Null Safety in Dart?
- Its nothing but a Variables cannot be null by default unless we explicitly allow it.
Example:
```dart
void main() {
  int age = null; // This will cause a compile-time error
}
```

- Sometimes we may need to allow a variable to hold null values during certain scenarios like when fetching data from an API where some fields may be missing.
- To allow a variable to be null, we can use the `?` operator after the data type.
Example:
```dart
void main() {
  int? age = null; // This is allowed
  print('Age: $age');
}
```

### What are the Benefits of Null Safety?
1. Reduce Runtime Errors: By catching null-related errors at compile-time, it helps to prevent unexpected crashes during program execution.
2. Eliminate the need for null checks: With null safety, we can avoid writing excessive null checks in our code, leading to cleaner and more readable code.

## Scenario 1 :
```dart
void main() {
  int? age; // Nullable variable
  print('Age: $age'); // Output: Age: null
  int validAge = age; // Compile-time error: It cannot assign null value to non-nullable variable
}
``` 
- In above example, we trying to assign a nullable variable `age` to a non-nullable variable `validAge`, which results in a compile-time error.
- To fix this, we need to tell that `validAge` will not be null using the null assertion operator `!`.

```dart
void main() {
  int? age; // Nullable variable
  print('Age: $age'); // Output: Age: null
  int validAge = age!; // Using null assertion operator
  print('Valid Age: $validAge'); // This will throw a runtime error if age is null
}
``` 

### Bonus:
1. #### String Interpolation 
- Lets say if we want to print a variable value inside a string, we can use String Interpolation using `$` sign before the variable name.

```dart
void main() {
  String name = 'Alice';
  print('Hello, $name!');
}
```
2. #### Check the data type of a variable using `runtimeType` property.

```dart
void main() {
  var number = 42;
  print('Data type of number: ${number.runtimeType}'); // Output: Data type of number: int
}
```
or
```dart
void main() {
  dynamic data = 'Hello';
  print('Data type of data (${data is String}) '); // Output: Data type of data: String
}
```
