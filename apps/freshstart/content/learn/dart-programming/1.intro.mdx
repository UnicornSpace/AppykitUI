## What is Dart?
- We all familiar with Flutter, its a openSource UI Framework to build cross-platform apps. And Dart is programming language used to build Flutter apps.

## What's the Background of Dart?
- Back in 2011, Google introduced a new programminglanguage called Dart as the Replacement for JavaScript.
Because :
1. JavaScript was Slow back in time for large and complex web applications.
2. Since Its a dynamically typed language, it was prone to runtime errors.
3. No proper Debugging tools.
4. Scalability issues for large codebases.

Thats why Google developed Dart to address these issues and provide a better alternative for building web applications.
And they went one step futher by creating a Browser called Dartium that had a built-in Dart VM to run Dart code directly without transpiling to JavaScript.

But It failed Because:
1. Lack of Browser Support: Browser companies like Mozilla,Apple and Microsoft were not interested in adding support for Dart in their browsers.
2. Developer Adoption: Developers were already familiar with JavaScript and its ecosystem, so they were reluctant to switch to a new language.And they don't want to buld apps which runs only on Dartium.

## Dart Comback
- Now Google want to introduce a new cross-platform UI framework called Flutter, which needed a Strong language like Dart to build high-performance apps.
Now Dart become Mainstream again, not as JS Killer but as engine behind Flutter.

## Importance of Dart
- One Language for Multiple Platforms: With Dart and Flutter, developers can write code once and deploy it across multiple platforms, including mobile (iOS and Android), web, and desktop.
- High Performance: Dart is designed for performance, with features like Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation that allows Flutter apps to run at native speed.
- Strong Typing and Tooling: Dart offers strong typing, which helps catch errors at compile time, along with a rich set of development tools that enhance productivity.
- Smooth UI Development: Dart's reactive programming model and Flutter's widget-based architecture make it easy to create smooth and responsive user interfaces.
- Clean Syntax to learn: Dart has a clean and easy-to-understand syntax, making it accessible for developers of all skill levels.

## Rescources to Learn Dart
- Courses and Tutorials: Dart And Flutter Series on Youtube ("https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9eMLfd38heN2BbPEng6W9qBLl3oJAtwD&si=w_gsoYnIUSzFBLeR")
- Official Dart Documentation: The official Dart website (https://dart.dev) provides comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and guides to help you get started with Dart programming.
- DartPad: An online Dart editor (https://dartpad.dev) that allows you to write, run, and share Dart code directly in your web browser without any setup.
- Flutter Documentation: Since Dart is primarily used with Flutter, the official Flutter documentation (https://flutter.dev/docs) is an excellent resource for learning how to build apps using Dart and Flutter together.


## What's Next?
- To Get Started an learn the basics if how to create Variables, Control Flow, Functions ,Operators ,Classes ,Interfaces and many more advanced concepts in Dart.
- In the Next Lesson, we will explore Variables and Null Safety in Dart. See you there! ([Next: Variables and Null Safety in Dart](variables_nullSafety) )
