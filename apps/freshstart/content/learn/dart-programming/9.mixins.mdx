## What are Mixins in Dart?
- A mixin is a class that contains a set of methods and properties that can be used by other classes. It is a way to reuse code across multiple classes.

Example : Lets say your desgning a car, whats the common things we see in all cars , like windows, wheels, engine etc and whats the common actions like driving, braking, accelerating. So we can create a class Car which will have all these common properties and behaviors.
