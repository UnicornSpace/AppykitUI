## What are Mixins in Dart?
- A mixin is a class that contains a set of methods and properties that can be used by other classes. It is a way to reuse code across multiple classes.

Example : Lets say your desgning a car, whats the common things we see in all cars , like windows, wheels, engine etc and whats the common actions like driving, braking, accelerating. So we can create a class Car which will have all these common properties and behaviors.

## Example to show why we need Mixins
<Steps>
<Step>
### Lets Create a Base Class
```dart
class Animal {
  void move() {
    print('Animal moves');
  }
}

```
<Callout type="info">
Here, `Animal` is a base class with a method `move`.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Now Lets Create Subclasses  `Fish` that Inherit from Animal
```dart
class Fish extends Animal {
  void swim() {
    print('Swimming');
  }
}

```
<Callout type="info">
Here, `Fish` inherits the `move` method from `Animal` and adds its own method `swim`.
</Callout>
</Step>


<Step>
### Now Lets Create Subclasses  `Bird` that Inherit from Animal
```dart
class Bird extends Animal {
  void fly() {
    print('Flying');
  }
}

```
<Callout type="info">
Here, `Bird` inherits the `move` method from `Animal` and adds its own method `fly`.
</Callout>
</Step>

</Steps>

## Problem with Inheritance
- Now, what if we want to create a class `Duck` that can both swim and fly? 
- With traditional inheritance, we can't inherit from both `Fish` and `Bird` because Dart does not support multiple inheritance.

## Solution: Using Mixins
- Mixins allow us to reuse code from multiple classes without using inheritance.
- A mixin represents what an object can do, not what it is.
<Steps>
<Step>
### Create mixins for behaviors
```dart
mixin CanFly {
  void fly() {
    print('Flying');
  }
}

mixin CanSwim {
  void swim() {
    print('Swimming');
  }
}

```
<Callout type="info">
`Mixins` are created with the `mixin` keyword and contain methods that can be reused.
Here, `CanFly` and `CanSwim` are mixins that provide flying and swimming behaviors.
</Callout>
</Step>


<Step>
### Base Animal class
```dart
class Animal {
  void move() {
    print('Animal moves');
  }
}
```
<Callout type="info">
Here, `Animal` is a base class with a method `move`.
</Callout>
</Step>


<Step>
### Use mixins with classes
```dart
class Fish extends Animal with CanSwim {}

class Bird extends Animal with CanFly {}
```
<Callout type="info">
Here, `Fish` uses the `CanSwim` mixin, and `Bird` uses the `CanFly` mixin, allowing them to have swimming and flying behaviors respectively.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Create Duck class that uses both mixins
```dart
class Duck extends Animal with CanFly, CanSwim {}
```
<Callout type="info">
Here, `Duck` uses both `CanFly` and `CanSwim` mixins, allowing it to both fly and swim.
</Callout>
</Step>

</Steps>
