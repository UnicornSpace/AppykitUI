## What is Control Flow?
- Control Flow in programming refers to the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls are executed or evaluated.
- Loops and conditional statements help control which code runs and how many times it runs.

---

## Conditional Statements 

- Conditional Statements are instructions that let your program to make decisions based on certain conditions.
- The code runs only when the condition evaluates to true.

### `if` Statement
- The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.

```dart
void main() {
  int number = 10;

  if (number > 0) {
    print('$number is a positive number.');
  }
}
```
---
### `if-else` Statement
- The `if-else` statement is used to execute one block of code if a condition is true, and another block if the condition is false.

```dart
void main() {
  int number = -5;

  if (number > 0) {
    print('$number is a positive number.');
  } else {
    print('$number is not a positive number.');
  }
}
```
---
### `else if` Statement
- The `else if` statement is used to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.

```dart  
void main() {
  int number = 0;

  if (number > 0) {
    print('$number is a positive number.');
  } else if (number < 0) {
    print('$number is a negative number.');
  } else {
    print('$number is zero.');
  }
}
```

---

## Loops
- Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true.

### `for` Loop
- The `for` loop is used to iterate over a range of values or a collection.

```dart
void main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    print('Iteration $i');
  }
}
```
--- 
### `while` Loop
- The `while` loop is used to execute a block of code as long as a specified
  condition is true.
  
```dart
void main(){
  int count = 1;

  while (count < 5) {
    print('Count: $count');
    count++;
  }
}
```
---
### `do-while` Loop
- The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it
  guarantees that the block of code will be executed at least once before checking the condition.

```dart 
void main() {
  int count = 1;

  do {
    print('Count: $count');
    count++;
  } while (count <= 5);
}
```
- `break` and  `continue` Statements can also be used within loops to control the flow of execution.
```dart
void main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    if (i == 5) {
      break; // Exit the loop when i is 5
    }
    if (i % 2 == 0) {
      continue; // Skip even numbers
    }
    print('Number: $i');
  }
}
```

---
## Assert Statement
- Its a function,that takes a condition as an argument and throws an error if the condition is false and if its true, the program continues executing normally.
- Its mainly used during development to catch bugs and validate assumptions in the code.

```dart
void main() {
  int age = 25;

  // Assert that age is greater than 0
  assert(age > 0, 'Age must be a positive number.');

  print('Age is valid: $age');
}
```

Assert statements are ignored in production (release) mode.
