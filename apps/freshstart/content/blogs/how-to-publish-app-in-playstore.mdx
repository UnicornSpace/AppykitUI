Your store listing is what users see on the Play Store. Make it compelling!

<Tabs items={['App Details', 'Graphics', 'Categorization']}>

<Tab value="App Details">

</Tab>

</Tabs>

</Step>

<Step>

### Complete Content Rating Questionnaire

Google requires all apps to have a content rating. This helps users understand if your app is appropriate for them.

1. Go to **Policy** → **App content**
2. Click **"Start questionnaire"**
3. Answer questions about your app's content
4. Submit to receive ratings from various boards (ESRB, PEGI, etc.)

</Step>

<Step>

### Set Up Pricing & Distribution

Configure where and how your app will be available:

<Accordions type="single">

<Accordion title="Pricing">

- Choose **Free** or **Paid**
- If paid, set your price (Google takes a 15-30% commission)
- Free apps cannot be converted to paid later

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Countries">

- Select which countries to distribute to
- Consider starting with specific markets for testing
- Expand globally after initial feedback

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Device Compatibility">

- Android TV
- Wear OS
- Android Auto
- Chrome OS

</Accordion>

</Accordions>

</Step>

<Step>

### Upload Your App Bundle

Upload your signed release build:

```bash
# Generate a signed Android App Bundle (recommended)
./gradlew bundleRelease

# Or generate a signed APK
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

<Callout type="info">
Google recommends using Android App Bundle (AAB) format instead of APK. AABs result in smaller downloads for users.
</Callout>

**Upload location:** Production → Releases → Create new release

</Step>

<Step>

Before publishing, complete the final checklist:

- [ ] Store listing is complete
- [ ] Content rating questionnaire submitted
- [ ] Pricing and distribution configured
- [ ] Privacy policy URL added
- [ ] App bundle uploaded
- [ ] Target API level meets requirements

Click **"Review release"** and then **"Start rollout to Production"**
